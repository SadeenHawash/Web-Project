              Reena grew up surrounded by the smell of sweet creations made from recipes created by her mother and grandmother.
              For young Ruby, the kitchen which was always filled with the scents of freshly baked cake, cocoa, sugar, and vanilla
              was her favorite place to be. Some of her favorite memories are in the kitchen baking with her mum or grandma and
              smothering her face in chocolate batter. Fast-forward a couple of years, the mother-daughter duo we're baking for school bake sales and charity funds. When the revolution happened, baking was their go-to fundraiser to help those
              in need.
              <br>Having witnessed her mother’s passion for baking and cooking firsthand, when Reena took a gap year between High
              school and university she was inspired to start Sugar Rush Cake Shop alongside her mum.
              <br>With the endless support of our family, We grew to open an official storefront and kitchen.

            <p>
              Quality and design have been a part of Nino’s mission from the very beginning. We are all about making great
              quality, beautiful and fun designs more accessible for all the beautiful moments our clients are celebrating. We
              also believe in maintaining the quality and integrity our families were raised on while being young, hip & cute. We see every client as a member of our own family, providing them with the best and helping them out whenever
              we can!
              <br>We believe in the essence of our homemade kitchen, we never use artificial flavors or additives in our cakes!
                Everything is baked fresh, and we use the very best natural ingredients available. Throughout the years we've
                worked hard to develop the best recipes, we love trying new recipes and techniques and there's really nothing
              we won't do in search of the perfect cake. To maintain our values and perfect our craft we prepare every addition
              to our cakes, including meringues, caramel, drips & croquet, from scratch every day. We also ensure that every
              cake is baked and decorated fresh to order.
              <br>Sugar Rush Cake Shop has another half to its mission – something that we would need our clients to rally
              around: ethical employment. We are committed to treating our workers like family because each and every
              single one of them has a special story with us. We've worked hard to create a group of cake & bakery-obsessed
              friends who are passionate about what they do.
